# AsteroidDodge
Basic game made in C# using windows forms.

The assets for the asteroids and spaceship do not belong to me and were found on the internet.

to play the game, download and run the .exe file.
Windows will give you warnings tell you its not safe because the .exe isn't published. you can download and compile the code yourself if you feel its unsafe.

the .exe file can be found here:
AsteroidDodge / bin / Debug / AsteroidDodge.exe
